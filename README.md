# Pimpkin

Node.js app (along with some suplementary sound files) to control few LEDs and play said sound files.
Primary application: to make a Halloween pumpkin scarier! >:>

## Getting started

### Get the code

Clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/VipSaran/pimpkin.git
    cd pimpkin
    npm install
    node app.js

Dependencies
------------

*omxplayer*

    sudo apt-get install fonts-freefont-ttf
    wget http://omxplayer.sconde.net/builds/omxplayer_0.3.5~git20140923~6ee9a0a_armhf.deb
    sudo dpkg -i omxplayer_0.3.5~git20140923~6ee9a0a_armhf.deb

### Things to configure (in `blink.js`)

GPIO pins used to control the LEDS:

    var gpioPin1 = 18; // header pin 18 = GPIO port 24
    var gpioPin2 = 22; // header pin 22 = GPIO port 25

Various timings:

    var interval = 100; // blinking interval (in ms)
    var pause = 5000; // delay (in ms) between consecutive scareThem (after the sound has finished)
    var duration = 300000; // duration of the "show" (in ms)

Want to randomly play the sound files? Change the default:

    var soundOrderRandom = false;

### Volume on Pi

My Pi had a really low audio output volume when I started testing the sound files. This is how you can easily configure it in shell:

    alsamixer

### All configured now?

Run the app:

    node blink.js

### Need more details!

Sorry. The code should speak for itself (and it should be a short speech).
